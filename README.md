# Weekly Tasks 📚

---

![tasks](img/tasks_done.png)

Lecture at [ATU](https://vlegalwaymayo.atu.ie/) by Mr. Andrew Beatty.

This repository contains programming exercises completed weekly for the *Programming and Scripting* module at ATU. The code is available in both `.py` and `.ipynb` formats, with rich annotations, visualisations, and examples for each task.

---
## Overview

The tasks progressively demonstrate Python concepts through practical examples. Each week tackles a different challenge to reinforce key programming techniques, ranging from basic input/output to file manipulation and plotting.

---

## Objectives

- Learn foundational Python programming.
- Apply logic and computation to real-world problems.
- Use libraries such as NumPy, Matplotlib, and Pandas.
- Practice scripting, visualisation, and basic data analysis.
- Reinforce independent problem solving through weekly assignments.

---

## Features

- Notebooks and scripts for Weeks 1–8.
- Descriptive markdown and inline explanations.
- Data visualisation and user interaction.
- Text parsing and error handling.
- External data file (`thewaroftheworlds.txt`) included.

---

## Usage

To explore the weekly tasks:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hugcamrom/Weekly-Tasks.git
cd Weekly-Tasks
```

Then:
- Run Python scripts using:
  ```bash
  python collatz.py
  ```
- Or open the notebook:
  ```bash
  jupyter notebook weeklytasks.ipynb
  ```

Some tasks require user input or command-line arguments (e.g., `es.py`).

## Installation

Make sure Python 3.x is installed, then optionally:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install jupyter numpy matplotlib pandas
```

---

## Tools and Libraries

- **Python 3.x** – Primary programming language.
- **NumPy** – Numerical computing (e.g., random, arrays).
- **Pandas** – Data handling (used in later weeks).
- **Matplotlib** – For plotting and histograms.
- **Jupyter Notebook** – For interactive code exploration.
- **Standard Libraries** – `os`, `sys`, `random`, `datetime`, `urllib.request`.

---

## Documentation and Insights

Each script or notebook cell includes:
- Purpose and task definition
- Step-by-step implementation
- Sample inputs/outputs
- Commentary or citations
- Plots (where applicable)

Highlights:
- **Week 2:** Currency input/output with formatting
- **Week 4:** Collatz sequence generator
- **Week 6:** Square root approximation using Newton’s method
- **Week 7:** Reading and analysing character frequency in a book
- **Week 8:** Overlay histogram with function plot `h(x) = x³`
